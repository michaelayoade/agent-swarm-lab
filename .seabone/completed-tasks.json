Create a system that monitors agent activity and detects when an agent is confused (spinning in loops, making no progress, hitting token limits). The system should:\n\n1. Add confusion detection to scripts/spawn-agent.sh:\n   - Monitor aider output for patterns indicating confusion\n   - Track token usage and detect when limits are approached\n   - Set a maximum confusion attempts threshold (configurable)\n   - Log confusion events with timestamps and reasons\n\n2. Create confusion detection functions:\n   - detect_confusion(): analyzes aider logs for confusion patterns\n   - should_escalate(): determines if escalation is needed\n   - log_confusion_event(): logs confusion to a structured file\n\n3. Update configuration in .seabone/config.json:\n   - Add confusion detection settings\n   - Add thresholds and timeouts\n\n4. Create a simple confusion log file format in .seabone/confusion-log.json\n\nFocus ONLY on detection logic first. Do NOT implement escalation yet. Keep changes minimal and focused on detection only.",

    "description": "Implement an escalation/delegation system for confused agents. The system should:\n\n1. **Agent self-awareness**: Add logic for agents to recognize when they're confused, stuck, or need clarification. Detection criteria:\n   - Multiple failed attempts at the same task\n   - Ambiguous instructions from user\n   - Missing context or files needed\n   - Technical blockers they can't resolve\n   - When they're asking the user for clarification instead of doing work\n\n2. **Escalation protocol**: When an agent detects confusion, it should:\n   - Log the confusion with specific details\n   - Stop current work to avoid wasting resources\n   - Send an escalation notification to the coordinator (Seabone) via Telegram\n   - Provide clear context about what's confusing and what's needed\n\n3. **Coordinator interface**: Enhance Seabone to:\n   - Receive escalation notifications\n   - Review the agent's confusion context\n   - Provide clarification or re-delegate with better instructions\n   - Optionally spawn a \"senior dev\" agent for complex issues\n\n4. **Senior dev agent role**: Create a specialized agent type that:\n   - Handles complex or ambiguous tasks\n   - Can analyze multiple approaches\n   - Makes architectural decisions\n   - Delegates sub-tasks to regular agents\n\n5. **Implementation changes**:\n   - Modify the agent runtime script to include confusion detection\n   - Add escalation functions to the agent template\n   - Update Seabone's tools to handle escalations\n   - Create a senior dev agent profile with higher reasoning capabilities\n   - Add logging for all escalations\n\n6. **Test scenarios**:\n   - Agent gets ambiguous instructions → escalates\n   - Agent can't find required files → escalates\n   - Agent hits technical blocker → escalates\n   - Complex task needs architectural decision → senior dev spawned\n\nThe goal is to prevent agents from spinning in confusion and instead get them back on track quickly through proper delegation.",
